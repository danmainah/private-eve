# Private Events

> This project was created to demonstrate an understanding of Rails associations

We built a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events. Users can create events. Events has a title, a specific date and time.

A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users. This required us to model many-to-many relationships and also to be very conscious about our foreign keys and class names.
